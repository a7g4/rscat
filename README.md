# Rapid Scene Composition & Analysis Tool

This is a tool written to visualise large point clouds.

Launching will render a default scene with points generated from a `sinc` function.

Camera orbit is performed by clicking and dragging, camera panning is performed by shift-clicking.

Data can be loaded by drag and dropping a csv onto the window. The input file must have 7 columns: X, Y, Z, R, G, B, Size.

Currently this supports very limited use cases and is only tested on Windows.
